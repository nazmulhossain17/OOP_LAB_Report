# Overloading Constructors and Functions in C#

## üìñ Project Overview
My Name is Syed Nazmul Hossain. ID: 2233081426. This project demonstrates the use of constructor overloading and method overloading in C#. It includes two classes: `Movie` and `Novel`, showcasing different ways to instantiate objects and display their details.

## üé¨ Movie Class
The `Movie` class represents a movie with the following properties:
- `Title`: The title of the movie.
- `Director`: The director of the movie.
- `ReleaseYear`: The year the movie was released.
- `Rating`: The movie's rating.

### Constructors
- **Default Constructor**: Initializes the movie with default values.
- **Parameterized Constructors**: Allows the creation of a movie with specified title, director, release year, and rating.

### Methods
- `DisplayDetails()`: Displays the movie details in a default format.
- `DisplayDetails(string format)`: Displays the movie details in a specified format (`short` or `full`).

## üìö Novel Class
The `Novel` class represents a novel with the following properties:
- `Name`: The title of the novel.
- `Writer`: The author of the novel.
- `Identifier`: The ISBN of the novel.
- `Cost`: The price of the novel.

### Constructors
- **Default Constructor**: Initializes the novel with default values.
- **Parameterized Constructors**: Allows the creation of a novel with specified title, author, ISBN, and price.

### Methods
- `DisplayDetails()`: Displays the novel details.
